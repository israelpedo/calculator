# Calculator

My first project using JavaScript. 
Using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed an intuitive and functional interface that performs basic math operations. 
This project was a significant milestone in my JavaScript learning, helping me better understand programming logic and DOM manipulation.
